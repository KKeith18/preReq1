# preReq1

This is the second problem for the prereq assesment
To run this program you need to run go build problem2.go then ./problem2 with a command line argument of an integer

I was not able to complete all the steps of the assessment but I believe that the built in sorting algorithms would follow Big-O time analysis albiet we would need a larger argument and a calculator to confirm.
